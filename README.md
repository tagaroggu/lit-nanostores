# lit-stores
A set of [Lit](https://lit.dev) controllers for different signals/stores libraries

## Supported signals/stores libraries
- [Nano stores](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores)
- [Vue reactivity](https://github.com/vuejs/core/tree/main/packages/reactivity#readme) (Note: reactive objects currently don't work, only refs; use `toRef` as workaround)
- [Preact signals](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/signals/)

Examples are shown in [`src/index.js`](https://github.com/tagaroggu/lit-nanostores/blob/main/src/index.js).
